# DIY Smart Zone Controller for Ducted Air Conditioning

![Zone Controller](images/zone-controller.png)

This is the ESPHome configuration for my custom-built smart zone controller — a project designed to make our ducted air conditioning system smarter, more efficient, and locally controlled.

It uses an ESP32-based KinCony KC868 relay board to control 24V AC dampers, integrates with Home Assistant, and uses presence sensors for occupancy-based heating and cooling.

> ⚠️ This is a work in progress. Expect some rough edges, and test before you deploy.
